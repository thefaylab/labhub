# Welcome to the Fay lab Labhub

The Faylab labhub is a work in progress.  

* Onboarding! : https://github.com/thefaylab/labhub/wiki/Onboarding-in-the-Fay-Lab

* Lab meeting schedule: https://github.com/thefaylab/labhub/wiki/Lab-meetings
* Travel procedures: https://github.com/thefaylab/labhub/blob/master/02-protocols/Travel.Rmd


The Labhub workshop and repository were created as part of the [**Open Science at OHSU**](http://www.ohsu.edu/blogs/researchnews/2017/12/04/open-science-panel-the-evolving-landscape-of-scientific-communication-dec-8/) event on December, 8 2017.

The Labhub repository was adapted from a Gitlab repository, which [Dr. Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/) and her colleagues built to onboard new students and postdoctoral fellows, and facilitate data management, transparency, the long-term value of research contributions, and a safe academic space.

Labhub is a work in progress.  We created this repository as an education and demonstration tool for faculty, postdocs, and students curious about how documentation, open science workflows, and tools like Github can contribute to a healthy and productive research environment.  Your ideas and contributions are welcome!

## What you'll find in the Labhub repository
Advice, tools, and examples are organized into four areas:  onboarding, protocols, housekeeping, and wiki.  

**Onboarding**

This folder includes an [example repository](https://github.com/apreshill/labhub/tree/master/01-onboarding/example) of resources for new students, graduate research assistants, research staff, and volunteers.  We've also created a [onboarding template](https://github.com/apreshill/labhub/blob/master/01-onboarding/template/onboarding.md) to help you think through the goals and issues important to your environment.

**Protocols**

Document, document, document!  Every lab has a story about an essential process that was lost when a postdoc, student, or research staff member moved on.  Having a shared system for documenting and versioning your protocols can help with the transition between lab members, manuscript writing, and reproducibility.  

This folder includes an [example protocol](https://github.com/apreshill/labhub/tree/master/02-protocols/example) from the [Hill lab](https://alison.rbind.io/), and a [template](https://github.com/apreshill/labhub/blob/master/02-protocols/template/protocol.md) to adapt for your own documentation.

**Housekeeping**

Need to find a team member's Skype ID, add someone to your Slack Team, save [meeting minutes](http://third-bit.com/teaching/community.html#meetings-meetings-meetings), or confirm when your next NIH progress report is due?  Check out our Housekeeping template to record everyday organizational data for easy sharing and retrieval.

**Wiki**

Use a [Wiki](https://github.com/apreshill/labhub/wiki) to document helpful but less formal information about working in your lab, like where to find coffee, pens, and a key for deciphering lab acronyms.

## You don't have to use Github for your Labhub!
The tools and strategies included in this repository can be translated to different environments.  There are many reasons why Github may not be the best solution for your team - maybe you're dealing with PHI data or most of your labmates aren't comfortable using Github.  In these cases, tools like [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), an electronic lab notebook, or even a simple folder structure might be the better starting place.

## A note about scope
This repository and the methods we suggest hardly scratch the surface when it comes to addressing research rigor and reuse, let alone sexism, racism, ageism, or ableism in a lab.  We plan to add a reading list to this repository which addresses these issues with more depth and breadth. 

## Contributing
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!  We want Labhub to be a community driven project and we want to know about your experience and ideas for facilitating transparency, reproducibility, safety, and inclusion in a research lab.

Please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request, or just fork this repository to use it in your lab.
